            <p>Picking up trash isn't something that people often think about when discussing sustainiability. We wanted to promote competition and gamify picking up trash at local parks in the area. By gamify picking up trash, we make it less of a chore and more fun to do with friends and family. Our web application allows for making new connections with others.</p>
            <p>Users can create a profile and join a group to begin competing against other users. All users will automatically be entered into a global leaderboard to track their process with others. Our web application monitors and tracks how much trash a environmentaist has picked up through a self-entry into our database. The web application verifies whether or not someone has picked up trash through the use of image recognition using OpenCV.</p>
            <p>Go on an adventure and clean up the Earth; become a Sustainateer!</p>
